			<!-- Main paragrapgh-->
			Here are a few short paragraphs about myself. I used to ride a motorcycle, I thoroughly enjoyed riding. My favorite part about riding was going through the "twisties" and "hitting" turns (leaning into/over) as far I could, to drag my pucks (a device attached to the knee and designed to be dragged against the ground). Night riding was my favorite thing to do. I had equipped my bike with numerous multi-color LED lights (legal in Maryland), and glowed like a super nova when riding on the empty highways at night.  </p>

			
	
		<p class="paragraph"> I don't have a particular genre of music I listen to. I listen to almost everything and anything. A few examples are: Classical, Rap, Pop, EDM, Hardstyle, Dubstep, K-pop, Rock, Instrumental, Traditional, etc... Some of my top favorite artists are G-Dragon, Sinatra, HeadHunterz, etc... </p>
